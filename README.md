  ## Description
  Note Taker is an app that you can create as many notes as you would like to keep track of to keep yourself organized. These notes will save and each note can be deleted as well.
  For every note created, there is a note title section and a note title section.

  This is a full-stack app which the back-end portion was created with Node.js and Express.js, and the front-end portion using JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap.
